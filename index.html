    <title>Making Full Use of the Client Resource Management Framework | Day of DotNetNuke, Charlotte, June 2, 2012 | by Brian Dukes @BrianDukes</title>
    
    <meta name="description" content="DotNetNuke 6.1 introduced the Client Resource Management framework to give developers and skinners a central mechanism for managing JavaScript and CSS that needs to be included in your site. The framework enables us to think about our scripts and styles much more logically, and leave the worries of optimizing behind. In this presentation, I’ll introduce the framework, show how and why to use it, and point out some tips and tricks to make it easier to use and manage." />
